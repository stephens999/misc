## Introduction

We know that 
$$X'Y = X'X \beta + X'X b + X'E$$
where 
$\beta$ represents the true effects and $b = \Sigma^{-1} \Gamma \delta$
represents the confounding effects, where $\Sigma=Cov(X)$.

The key assumption of LDSC is that the prior on rows of $\Gamma$ (a p-vector
in the case $q=1$) is
homoskedastic. Waving our hands we can argue prior on $X'X \Sigma^{-1} \Gamma$
is homoskedastic, since we might expect $X'X \Sigma^{-1}$ to be close to the identity. However, this is high dimensions so this I'm not sure how
reliable this argument is. Also what if $\Sigma$ is singular? Can we make 
these ideas rigorous?

In addition, can we model the fact that $X'X \Sigma^{-1} \Gamma$ must lie in the row space of $X$ while keeping the homoskedastic nature?


I thought I would start by looking at the distribution of 
$$X'X \Sigma^{-1}$$ when $X$ is not full rank.

```{r}
p = 100
n = 10
V = matrix(rnorm(p*p),nrow=p,ncol=p)
D = rep(1,p)
V[,1] = c(rep(1,10),rep(0,90))
V[,2] = c(rep(0,10),rep(1,90))
D[1] = 100
D[2] = 100
V = t(D*t(V))
Sigma = V %*% t(V)
s = diag(Sigma)
Sigma = (1/sqrt(s)) * Sigma
Sigma = t((1/sqrt(s)) * t(Sigma))

plot(Sigma[1,])


X = mvtnorm::rmvnorm(n, sigma = Sigma)
Sinv = chol2inv(chol(Sigma))
XtXSinv = t(X) %*% X %*% Sinv

plot(XtXSinv[1,])
plot(XtXSinv[2,])
plot(XtXSinv[1,],XtXSinv[2,])

plot(XtXSinv[11,], XtXSinv[12,])
plot(XtXSinv[1,],XtXSinv[11,])

plot(XtXSinv , t(X) %*% X)
```
